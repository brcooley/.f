#	Bash script to "plugin" to the dotfile repository, does a lot of fun stuff
#		like turning the normal dotfiles (eg .bashrc) into symlinks to this
#		repository's versions of those files (ensure that updates are just a
#		'git pull' away), optionally appending these files to the currently
#		existing versions, setting up a cron job to automate the 
#		aforementioned git pull, and maybe some more fun stuff
#
